### Clan System

The clan level system is quite basic but interestic and kindof different than others (Currently the amount of xp needed to level up isn't set however The amount of xp you lose, you gain can be configured in config.yml).
The first level is 100 xp (Leader can invite 2 members only), after the clan has more than 100 xp, they will level up and reach level 2.
Now, every levelup will open one more space for members for the clan. After you level up, the xp needed to levelup + 250 xp will be needed for next level up i.e, to get level 3 you need to get 350xp (100 + 250).

If you die you lose xp.
